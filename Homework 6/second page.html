<h3>Additionally, my favorite poem:</h3>
<br>
Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
<br>
freak of nature, they will wrap his body
<br>
in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
<br>
But tonight he is alive and in the north
<br>
field with his mother. It is a perfect
<br>
summer evening: the moon rising over
<br>
the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
<br>
as he stares into the sky, there are
<br>
twice as many stars as usual.
