    <br>
    <h3>Additionally, my favorite poem:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Tomorrow when the farm boys find this<br>
    freak of nature, they will wrap his body<br>
    in newspaper and carry him to the museum.<br>
    But tonight he is alive and in the north<br>
    field with his mother. It is a perfect<br>
    summer evening: the moon rising over<br>
    the orchard, the wind in the grass. And<br>
    as he stares into the sky, there are<br>
    twice as many stars as usual.</p>
